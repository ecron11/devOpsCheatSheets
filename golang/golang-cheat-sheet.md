# Golang Cheatsheet
## This is a cheatsheet for golang syntax, commands, and concepts

### Syntax - Basic
```go
var name type = expression
```
Single Variable declaration

```go
var var1name,var2name type
```
Declaring multiple variables of the same type

```go
stringVar1,stringVar2,NumberVar1 := "StringValue1","StringValue2", 123
```
Declaring multiple types of variables in a single line using the := operator. The := is the short variable declaration operator. This operator allows you to omit the var keyword and type when declaring and initializing a variable at the same time.
