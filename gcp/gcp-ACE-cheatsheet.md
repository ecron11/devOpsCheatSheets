# GCP Associate Cloud Engineer
A cheatsheet/notes for the Associate Cloud Engineer Exam

## Concepts
### Cloud Comparisons
Compared to AWS, Google is a more Dev-focused cloud, being more dev towards ops vs. ops towards dev. Additionally, GCP focuses more on tools that you couldn't reasonably do on your own, whereas AWS focuses on things that you could do, but shouldn't have to.

### Intrinsically Global
GCP is global focused as opposed to AWS which is region-focused. Easier to handle latency and failures in a global way, but more sensitive to multi-region/global failure modes.

### Zones
A group of data centers. Meant to completely be independant of eachother

### Region
A group of zones. They can communicate quickly with one another

### Multi-Region
A group of regions

### Private Global network
GCP's private network of connected multi-regions

### POPs
Points of presence. Network Edges and CDN locations

### Projects
Similar to AWS accounts. Resources are generally owned by an account, although there can be cross-project resources.
